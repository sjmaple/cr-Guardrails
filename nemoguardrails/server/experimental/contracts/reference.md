# Guard contract reference

This is the syntax and semantic specification for guard contract version
`1.0.0-alpha.1` (experimental) in the NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails library. Start with
the [README](README.md) for a complete small example and the editing workflow.
This reference defines what an implementation must preserve.

The [authoring schema](guard-contract.schema.json) defines accepted syntax:
a limited subset of JSON Schema with local `x-nemo-guardrails` annotations.

## Authority and scope

The pinned provider description owns HTTP paths, source schemas, and provider
facts. A guard contract selects a supported boundary; it does not redefine the
whole provider API or claim to configure all detectors, prompts, input/output
rails, or deployment settings.

Request and response policy describes structural acceptance and guarded subjects.
The deployment separately selects which rails inspect that content and whether a
rail result permits, rejects, or replaces it. A marked subject is a guardable
surface, not a guarantee that every deployment runs a particular safety check.

## Examples

Begin with the [minimal contract](minimal.guard.example.yaml), paired with
its [provider OpenAPI](minimal.openapi.example.yaml). The
[OpenAI Chat Completions contract](openai/chat-completions.guard.yaml) is a
complete request, buffered response, and stream example.

For authoring and validation steps, use the [guard contract guide](README.md).

## Payload Projections

A Payload Projection is a normal OpenAPI Schema Object with local guardrail
annotations. It describes either a request or a buffered JSON response.

### Minimal request example

```yaml
request:
  type: object
  additionalProperties: true
  title: example.chat.request.text.v1
  properties:
    messages:
      type: array
      minItems: 1
      maxItems: 1
      items:
        type: object
        additionalProperties: true
        title: ExampleUserMessageProjection
        properties:
          role:
            const: user
            x-nemo-guardrails:
              classification: constrained
          content:
            type: string
            minLength: 1
            x-nemo-guardrails:
              classification: guarded
              subject:
                kind: text
                role: user
                replaceable: true
        required: [role, content]
        x-nemo-guardrails:
          model: ExampleUserMessageProjection
          source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderUserMessage'
          unknown_fields: configurable
      x-nemo-guardrails:
        classification: guarded
    stream:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      x-nemo-guardrails:
        classification: constrained
    model:
      x-nemo-guardrails:
        classification: opaque
  required: [messages]
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    model: ExampleChatGuardedRequestProjection
    stream_selector_field: stream
```

The schema describes the local request policy. Do not declare the source
schema, direction, or capability profile on the projection root: they come from
`operationId`, the `request` or `response` key, and the top-level `profile`.
Optional `title` and `x-nemo-guardrails.model` give stable projection and
class-name overrides. `stream_selector_field` identifies the boolean request
field that selects streaming.

### Complete field accounting

Every field declared by a bound provider object must be classified exactly
once:

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `guarded` | Contains or leads to content that rails inspect. |
| `constrained` | Narrows the provider shape so guarded extraction, replacement, or response handling is safe and unambiguous. |
| `opaque` | Remains provider-owned and is forwarded without interpretation by the library. |
| local extension | Does not exist in the provider source; it is an explicitly capability-gated compatibility field. |

For example:

```yaml
properties:
  input:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    x-nemo-guardrails:
      classification: guarded
      subject:
        kind: text
        role: user
        replaceable: true

  response_format:
    type: 'null'
    default: null
    x-nemo-guardrails:
      classification: constrained
      gate: disabled
      reason: projection_policy.plain_text_output

  temperature:
    x-nemo-guardrails:
      classification: opaque
```

This is the provider-drift boundary: a field that the provider adds later must
not reach the guarded boundary without an explicit review decision.
Provider-aware validation, which compares the contract with the pinned provider
source, enforces this; it is not part of this format definition.

`opaque` does not mean "unknown" or "ignored." It records a deliberate decision
that the field does not affect the guarded capability and can remain under
provider authority. Opaque does not mean trusted or safe: the entire value is
delegated to the provider.

`opaque_fields` is shorthand for individually annotated opaque properties on
this object. Names must be explicit and unique, cannot overlap `properties`,
and cannot use wildcards. It does not review nested fields inside an opaque
value. New known fields at a selected boundary require review even when
runtime unknown fields are allowed.

### Guarded subjects

A subject marks the content that rails inspect and declares its meaning: its
kind, its role, and its replacement policy. This version supports one kind,
`text`, because rails currently inspect text only. Other kinds require new
capability profiles.

A contract declares exactly one `profile`, which governs its request, response,
and stream. Profiles are not combined: an operation that carries text and images in
one turn needs its own profile that defines how those subjects relate, rather
than a text profile and an image profile side by side.

The `single_text.v1` profile identifies one user or assistant text subject.
Selected native representations do not permit multiple independent subjects.
Because each direction has exactly one subject, its role currently matches the
direction: request subjects are `user` and response subjects are `assistant`.
`role` remains required so that profiles carrying several subjects in one
direction, such as a full conversation, can distinguish them.
Replacement may affect only the selected text; unrelated metadata and declared
replacement restrictions must be preserved.

A direct guarded string declares its provider-neutral meaning:

```yaml
content:
  type: string
  minLength: 1
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: guarded
    subject:
      kind: text
      role: assistant
      replaceable: true
```

Subject keys are:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `kind` | Required content kind. This version accepts only `text`. |
| `role` | Required. `user` for input or `assistant` for generated output. |
| `replaceable` | Whether a buffered rail decision may replace this provider field. The `single_text.v1` profile requires it; the authoring schema does not enforce that requirement. |
| `replacement_blocked_by` | Related provider field that may make replacement unsafe. |
| `replacement_reason` | Structured reason for a restriction on replacement. |

For example, replacing cited text may invalidate its citations:

```yaml
subject:
  kind: text
  role: assistant
  replaceable: true
  replacement_blocked_by: citations
  replacement_reason: provider_integrity.cited_text
```

Replacement is permitted only when the related field is absent. If
`replaceable` is false, or replacement is conditional, a `replacement_reason`
is required.

Replacement policy is declared, not yet executed: the guarded proxy rejects every
replacement decision until safe replacement is implemented. Declaring it now
keeps each contract's replacement review next to the field it protects.

### Constraints and capability gates

Standard JSON Schema keywords describe the narrowed provider value. The format
accepts these selection and validation keywords:

```text
type, const, default, enum,
minItems, maxItems, minLength, maxLength, pattern
```

The authoring schema rejects other schema keywords and unknown
`x-nemo-guardrails` keys. Other `x-*` schema annotations are available to other
tooling and ignored by the library. Keys beginning with `x-nemo-guardrails` are
reserved; only the exact `x-nemo-guardrails` key is accepted. Descriptive annotations such as `description` and `examples` are not
treated as constraints. Opaque properties cannot carry validation assertions:
classify a property as constrained when the guard projection should validate it.
A disabled gate must agree with its null-only schema.

Examples include selecting one role:

```yaml
role:
  const: user
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: constrained
```

and restricting generation to one output:

```yaml
n:
  const: 1
  default: 1
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: constrained
    reason: core_capability.single_text_target
```

A disabled capability uses a null-only projection:

```yaml
tools:
  type: 'null'
  default: null
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: constrained
    gate: disabled
    reason: core_capability.tool_content
```

`gate: disabled` means the guarded operation does not support that capability;
it does not mean the provider lacks it. A gated field must be constrained and
must provide a reason. A disabled field may be absent or null but must not
enable the unsupported feature. Do not disguise this local restriction as a
provider fact.

Reason identifiers use one of these namespaces:

| Prefix | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `core_capability.*` | The shared runtime capability does not yet support the provider feature. |
| `provider_integrity.*` | Accepting or changing the value could invalidate related provider data or protocol guarantees. |
| `projection_policy.*` | The chosen guarded projection deliberately narrows otherwise supported provider behavior. |

Use a stable lower-case identifier after the prefix, for example
`core_capability.tool_content`. Reasons are reviewable policy identifiers, not
free-form explanations.

### Defaults

`default` is an annotation, not permission to insert an absent property into
the forwarded provider payload. An implementation may use defaults internally;
that does not authorize rewriting provider input. See the
[JSON Schema annotation guidance](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/annotations).

### Requiredness

The standard object-level `required` array determines which properties must be
present in the guarded projection. Properties omitted from this array are
optional, even when the provider requires them. Keep a policy `reason` on a
property when deliberately changing provider requiredness.

```yaml
required: [messages]
```

Field-level `x-nemo-guardrails.required` is not accepted. Optionality does not
imply nullability in JSON Schema: the value schema must explicitly permit null.
Provider-required opaque values remain under provider authority rather than
being promoted to local validation.

### Nested objects and arrays

Attach object metadata to every nested object that the projection traverses:

```yaml
message:
  type: object
  properties:
    content: {}
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: guarded
    model: ExampleMessageProjection
    source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderMessage'
    unknown_fields: configurable
```

For an array, put the nested object metadata on `items` and classify the array
field itself:

```yaml
messages:
  type: array
  minItems: 1
  maxItems: 1
  items:
    type: object
    title: ExampleMessageProjection
    properties: {}
    x-nemo-guardrails:
      model: ExampleMessageProjection
      source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderMessage'
      unknown_fields: configurable
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: guarded
```

Author a direct guarded array with `minItems: 1` and `maxItems: 1` when the
guarded target is its first item. For union variants, the current
`single_text.v1` profile requires an `exactly_one` matching selection.
Cardinality is therefore part of safety, not merely validation convenience.

### Union variants

Arrays and alternatives must identify the supported text unambiguously.
Explicit match selectors must agree with declared constant fields. Authored
alternative order must not supply identity. The `single_text.v1` profile also
requires nonempty text and an unambiguous traversal.

Use variants when an array contains a provider union and only selected object
variants participate in the guarded capability:

```yaml
content:
  type: array
  minItems: 1
  maxItems: 1
  items:
    oneOf:
      - type: object
        title: ExampleTextBlockProjection
        properties:
          type:
            const: text
            x-nemo-guardrails:
              classification: constrained
          text:
            type: string
            minLength: 1
            x-nemo-guardrails:
              classification: guarded
              subject:
                kind: text
                role: assistant
                replaceable: true
        required: [type, text]
        x-nemo-guardrails:
          model: ExampleTextBlockProjection
          source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderTextBlock'
          unknown_fields: configurable
          variant:
            match:
              type: text
            cardinality: exactly_one
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: guarded
```

`variant.match` can be omitted when required properties with `const` values
identify the variant. An explicit match must correspond to those selected
constants. `cardinality` is one of `any`, `at_most_one`, or `exactly_one`, although
the current payload profile requires `exactly_one` for the guarded target.

### Alternative text representations

Use a field-level `oneOf` when the same semantic text may use different native
encodings, such as a string or a one-element text-block array:

```yaml
content:
  oneOf:
    - type: string
      minLength: 1
      x-nemo-guardrails:
        subject:
          kind: text
          role: user
          replaceable: true
    - type: array
      minItems: 1
      maxItems: 1
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          text:
            type: string
            minLength: 1
            x-nemo-guardrails:
              classification: guarded
              subject:
                kind: text
                role: user
                replaceable: true
        x-nemo-guardrails:
          model: ExampleInputTextBlockProjection
          source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderInputTextBlock'
          unknown_fields: configurable
      x-nemo-guardrails: {}
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: guarded
```

Each representation must lead to exactly one subject with the same
provider-neutral meaning.

### Unknown-field policies

Use standard `additionalProperties` for object closure. Add
`x-nemo-guardrails.unknown_fields: configurable` only for a content boundary
whose closure the runtime may override:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `additionalProperties: true` or omitted | Accept additional provider fields. |
| `additionalProperties: false` | Reject additional fields, while retaining declared opaque properties. |
| `unknown_fields: configurable` with `additionalProperties: true` | Accept additional fields by default and allow the runtime's closed-content policy to reject unreviewed extras. |

Use `additionalProperties` for allow/forbid behavior rather than duplicating it
in the extension.

These policies do not replace field accounting against the pinned provider
contract. Known provider fields at a guarded boundary must still be marked
guarded, constrained, or opaque.

### Local extension fields

Occasionally a compatibility layer adds a field that is not claimed by the
provider source. Mark it explicitly:

```yaml
reasoning_content:
  type: 'null'
  default: null
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    classification: constrained
    extension: true
    gate: disabled
    reason: core_capability.reasoning_content
```

A local extension must be a disabled constrained capability. Do not use
`extension: true` to avoid proving that a real provider field exists.

## Stream Projections

Stream policy describes decoded provider data events and declared SSE framing.
It does not implicitly upgrade the source to OpenAPI 3.2 transport `itemSchema`.

A Stream Projection describes complete SSE event payloads, one event at a
time. It does not describe cross-event ordering. Stateful sequence validation
and provider-native error framing belong to the stream hooks bound under
`integration.endpoint.stream_hooks`.

### Stream root

```yaml
stream:
  title: example.chat.stream.text.v1
  oneOf:
    - type: object
      title: ExampleStreamPayloadProjection
      properties:
        object:
          const: chat.chunk
          x-nemo-guardrails:
            classification: constrained
        choices:
          type: array
          maxItems: 1
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              delta:
                type: object
                properties:
                  content:
                    type: string
                    x-nemo-guardrails:
                      classification: guarded
                      subject:
                        kind: text
                        role: assistant
                x-nemo-guardrails:
                  classification: guarded
                  model: ExampleStreamDeltaProjection
                  unknown_fields: configurable
                  source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderStreamDelta'
            x-nemo-guardrails:
              model: ExampleStreamChoiceProjection
              unknown_fields: configurable
              source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderStreamChoice'
          x-nemo-guardrails:
            classification: guarded
      required: [object, choices]
      x-nemo-guardrails:
        model: ExampleStreamPayloadProjection
        source: '#/components/schemas/ProviderChatStreamEvent'
        event:
          classification: guarded_delta
          variants:
            - source_schema: ProviderChatStreamEvent
              shape: chat.chunk:content
              match:
                object: chat.chunk
              required_fields: []
          missing_text: opaque
          missing_text_shape: chat.chunk:metadata
  x-nemo-guardrails:
    event_schema_binding: operation_response
    transport:
      require_sse_event: false
      non_data_shape: '[DONE]'
      sentinels:
        '[DONE]': '[DONE]'
```

Root stream keys are:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `event_schema_binding` | `operation_response` when the SSE response reaches the event schema; `component` only when justified by external evidence. |
| `event_schema_reason` | Required reason for a component-only binding and forbidden for an operation-bound one. |
| `transport` | SSE discriminator, event-field, non-data, and sentinel behavior. |

Transport keys are:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `data_discriminator` | JSON property used by the provider stream union discriminator, when present. |
| `require_sse_event` | Require the SSE `event:` field to match the JSON discriminator. |
| `non_data_shape` | Shape name for SSE events without a `data:` field. |
| `sentinels` | Map exact non-JSON `data:` values to stable shape names. |

When `require_sse_event` is true, `data_discriminator` is required.

### Stream event review

Every schema in the selected provider stream union must be accepted or named
in `excluded_stream_events` with a nonblank author reason:

```yaml
excluded_stream_events:
  - reason: outside_single_text_stream_profile
    sources: [ProviderAudioDeltaEvent, ProviderAudioDoneEvent]
```

Unknown, duplicate, stale, or simultaneously accepted/excluded entries are
errors. A new event schema must require a new author decision; implicit
rejection is insufficient as source-update review. External provider-error
variants still need an `external_reason`. Nested provider unions are covered by
the ordinary selection rules; the exclusion list covers top-level event schemas,
not every future nested union alternative.

### Event families

Each root `oneOf` entry, such as `ExampleStreamPayloadProjection` in the
preceding example, is an event family: one projection model and one guardrail
role shared by one or more native provider variants.

Event classifications are:

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `guarded_delta` | Carries a new text delta that rails inspect. |
| `snapshot` | Carries accumulated text checked against previously observed deltas. |
| `opaque` | Contains no guarded content. |
| `provider_error` | Provider-native in-stream failure. |

Each event variant has:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `source_schema` | Provider component represented by this variant. |
| `shape` | Stable shape name returned after classification. |
| `match` | Dotted JSON selectors and scalar values that identify the event. |
| `required_fields` | Top-level fields that must be required to distinguish the event. |
| `external_reason` | Evidence reason for a provider-error schema accepted outside the primary stream union. Other external variants are not supported. |

A variant must have at least one `match` entry or required field. Selectors
must be provable against the provider schema and must not be duplicated. Rules
must also be semantically disjoint: an event that matches more than one rule is
rejected.

### Text paths are derived

Authors do not write a text path. They mark the nested text property with a
guarded subject, and the path follows from that marking. In the preceding
example it is `choices[0].delta.content`. Keeping the path derived prevents
extraction from drifting away from the schema that validates it.

### Events without text

An opaque event family is not an opaque property: the family still has a
selected schema and constrained fields. Those constraints remain enforced even
though the family has no subject.

A structurally valid event in a guarded family may omit its text field. Choose
that behavior explicitly:

| `missing_text` | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `reject` | Reject the event. This is the default. |
| `opaque` | Reclassify it as metadata; `missing_text_shape` may give it a distinct shape, otherwise the original shape is reused. |
| `empty` | Treat it as an empty text snapshot. |

Only `guarded_delta` families may use `opaque`; only `snapshot` families may
use `empty`.

For example, the chat chunks in the stream root example may carry role, usage,
or finish metadata without a content delta:

```yaml
event:
  classification: guarded_delta
  variants: [...]
  missing_text: opaque
  missing_text_shape: chat.chunk:metadata
```

### Runtime classification and hooks

At runtime, each event family becomes stream event rules evaluated by a
stateless classifier. Each classification maps to one runtime role:

| Classification | Runtime role |
| --- | --- |
| `guarded_delta` | `StreamEventRole.GUARDED_TEXT` |
| `snapshot` | `StreamEventRole.TEXT_SNAPSHOT` |
| `opaque` | `StreamEventRole.OPAQUE_METADATA` |
| `provider_error` | `StreamEventRole.PROVIDER_ERROR` |

The guarded family in the stream root example corresponds to this rule:

```python
StreamEventRule(
    shape="chat.chunk:content",
    model=ExampleStreamPayloadProjection,
    role=StreamEventRole.GUARDED_TEXT,
    match=(("object", "chat.chunk"),),
    text_path=("choices", 0, "delta", "content"),
    missing_text_role=StreamEventRole.OPAQUE_METADATA,
    missing_text_shape="chat.chunk:metadata",
)
```

The text path means `payload["choices"][0]["delta"]["content"]`.

The classifier answers questions about one event in isolation:

- Is its JSON shape valid?
- Which declared variant matched?
- Does it carry guarded text, a snapshot, metadata, or an error?
- What text should the shared runner inspect?

Handwritten hooks answer questions that require history or executable provider
behavior:

- Was a block started before receiving its delta?
- Is this event legal after the preceding event?
- Did the stream end with unfinished provider state?
- How should a Guardrails failure be framed as provider-native SSE?

Hooks implement `ProviderStreamHooks`: `observe_event`,
`validate_end_of_stream`, and `encode_error`. The hooks factory takes no
arguments and is called once for every upstream stream, so each stream gets
fresh hook state; the stateless classifier is shared.

## Integration and stable identities

`integration.endpoint` holds error codes and optional route, label, stream-hook,
and API-revision bindings. When `route_path` or `operation_label` is omitted,
the route defaults to the selected provider path and the label is derived from
the operation name. Stateful stream behavior is implemented by the declared
hook; changing a hook is a behavior change.

```yaml
integration:
  name: chat
  endpoint:
    route_path: /v1/chat
    operation_label: Example Chat
    unsupported_request_code: unsupported_example_chat_shape
    unsupported_response_code: unsupported_example_chat_response_shape
    stream_hooks:
      module: example_guardrails_provider.chat.stream_hooks
      name: ExampleChatStreamHooks
    api_revision:
      module: example_guardrails_provider.chat.api_revision
      name: EXAMPLE_API_REVISION
```

Endpoint keys are:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `route_path` | Runtime route; it must match the provider operation, optionally with a concrete leading API-version segment. |
| `operation_label` | Human-readable name used in diagnostics. |
| `unsupported_request_code` | Provider-facing error code for unsupported request shapes. |
| `unsupported_response_code` | Provider-facing error code for unsupported response or stream shapes. |
| `stream_hooks` | Optional provider-package Python symbol for stateful streaming behavior. |
| `api_revision` | Optional provider-package symbol that binds the provider API revision. |

Python symbols must live inside the provider's runtime package. Stream hooks are
required when a stream projection is bound and forbidden when no stream
projection exists.

`integration.name` names the integration. When omitted, it is derived from
`operationId`, for example `createText` becomes `create_text`. `title` and
`x-nemo-guardrails.model` give projections and models stable names; renaming
them is a visible change. Unnamed object alternatives need an explicit source or
one event variant so their derived identity does not depend on list position.

Types may be inferred only where unambiguous. A scalar whose provider type is
nullable, a union, or absent needs an explicit type. Selecting an object union
may require `x-nemo-guardrails.source`. No classification or subject is inferred.

## `x-nemo-guardrails` quick reference

The meaning of a key depends on where the extension is attached. The same
extension name is intentionally local rather than one large embedded document.

### Projection object metadata

These keys appear on a root projection or nested object Schema Object:

| Key | Applies to | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | payload and stream objects | Optional Python model-name override. An identifier-valued `title` supplies the default. |
| `source` | payload and stream objects | Provider component reference. Root bindings are derived; use it on nested objects that select a named provider schema and omit it for inline objects. |
| `unknown_fields` | payload and stream objects | Optional runtime configurability; ordinary closure comes from `additionalProperties`. |
| `stream_selector_field` | request root | Field whose boolean value selects a streaming response. |
| `event_schema_binding` | stream root | `operation_response` or `component`. |
| `event_schema_reason` | stream root | Required structured reason for a component-only stream binding. |
| `transport` | stream root | Stream framing and discriminator metadata. |

### Field metadata

These keys appear on a property Schema Object:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `classification` | `guarded`, `constrained`, or `opaque`. |
| `subject` | Direct guarded-text meaning and replacement policy. |
| `reason` | Structured capability, integrity, or projection-policy rationale. |
| `gate` | Currently only `disabled`; requires a constrained field and reason. |
| `extension` | Marks a local compatibility field absent from the provider source. Only valid for a disabled constrained field. |
| `model` | Optional model name for a nested object, overriding its `title`. |
| `source` | Binds that nested object to a provider component. |
| `unknown_fields` | Sets that nested object's unknown-field policy. |

Array item objects carry `title`, optional `model`, `source`, and `unknown_fields` on the
`items` Schema Object. A field-level representation branch carries either a
direct `subject` or an annotated `items` object, not an ordinary field
classification.

### Variant, event, and endpoint metadata

| Location | Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| object union branch | `variant.match` | Optional selector override; defaults to required properties with `const` values. |
| object union branch | `variant.cardinality` | `any`, `at_most_one`, or `exactly_one`. |
| stream event family | `event.classification` | `guarded_delta`, `snapshot`, `opaque`, or `provider_error`. |
| stream event family | `event.variants` | Provider schemas and selectors represented by the family. |
| stream event family | `event.missing_text` | `reject`, `opaque`, or `empty`. |
| stream event family | `event.missing_text_shape` | Optional alternate shape used when guarded text is absent. |

## Validation and compatibility limits

There are three different checks: authoring syntax, provider-aware semantic
validation, and runtime enforcement. A generic JSON Schema validator knows only
standard assertions; it does not enforce subjects, configurable policies,
variant cardinality, review decisions, or hook behavior. Provider coverage,
source reachability, text-target cardinality, and hook compatibility require
validation against the provider source.

This version supports component-reference operation roots, JSON requests, HTTP
200 JSON responses, and optional HTTP 200 SSE responses. Only the documented
single-text profiles are supported. Tools, images, audio, multiple independent
guarded messages, structured output, and other semantic content kinds require
explicit shared runtime capability designs.

Public JSON Schema and runtime acceptance are not identical in every case.
Selected-variant cardinality, optional/null/default handling, provider-owned
requiredness, and disabled gates are known areas where the two can differ.

If an implementation and this specification disagree, treat it as a defect and
resolve it explicitly; do not silently weaken either definition.

The alpha label makes no stable compatibility promise; see the
[version policy](README.md#version-and-stability).
